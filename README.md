# README

This is a simple Rails app that allows a user to enter an idea on a page, and have that idea persisted.

To deploy to your own server: 

* Clone from Github
* Add the files to a directory on your server
* run bundle
* run rails server


Coming soon: Users, User Admin, and User Permissions
